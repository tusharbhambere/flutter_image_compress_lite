### Fully removing CocoaPods

The upstream `flutter_image_compress_common` has a podspec which forces Flutter to run
`pod install`. To eliminate CocoaPods entirely, also override the upstream with the
`override` branch (no podspec, no plugin registration):

```yaml
dependency_overrides:
  flutter_image_compress_common:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/qeepcologne/flutter_image_compress_lite.git
      ref: override
```
